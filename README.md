# Introduction to Softi

## CreativeProgramming(C++)
Im not good at C++. I should practice C++ code again. I studied C++ when I was a freshman, 2nd semester. But now I forgot C++. So, I should study it.

* C++study: Practice codes of C++. Look over them again.

* HWn: Homework codes of Creative Programming Class (1-2).

* HW10: The Monti hole game.

## OS_practice
My favorite field: Operating Sytem.

I will add more system codes.

## mentoring
The tutoring, mentoring directory.

Langauge: Python, C.

* material: mentoring pdf files.

* mentoring_code: practice codes for mentoring classes.

They are for newbies.

## ubuntu
In this directory, there are text files about Ubuntu.

Include

How to set the initial system.

How to fix errors of Ubuntu.

Commands of Ubuntu.

## HMC
The challenging codes.
Challenging, curious, favorite, and smart.

* DailyProgramming: DailyProgramming suggests a programming problem daily. Then I solve it.

* SudokuSolution: The program which solves a sudoku game.

* etc: et cetera.
``` getch.h: getch linux version code ``` 

## dataStructure
In the dataStructure directory, there are codes of data structures.

1. basic: In fact, not a data structure. It is just for calculations and dynamic allocations.

2. linkedList

3. binarySearchTree

4. stack

5. heap

6. AVL_Tree

7. graph

8. disjointSetMaze: Not a data structure. This code is used for making a maze with disjoint sets.

9. dijkstra: Not a data structure. It is the dijkstra algorithm using a graph.

10. BFS_DFS: Not a data structure. They are the Breadth-First Search code and the Depth-First Search code.

11. hash

## test
It is a directory for testing codes.
